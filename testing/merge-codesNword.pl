# Purpose:
#
# To create a file for testing paradigm generation by combining a tag list
# and a word (supposedly the base form).
#
#	ARG1:	input file with inflectional tags
#	ARG2:	the base form of the word we want to inflect
#
# Output file:
#
#	Baseform+tags for all tags given in the tag file
#	This can directly be given to xfst for word form generation

# This is not enough: there was not explicit requirement of v_n tag of different length,
# yet this is apparently the case. This should be solved in a different way, the more
# it strongly resembles the hid attribute used for smanob.

# These +v1 etc. tags shall be parametrized for use by dict only (separate folder)
# or eventually via the â€¦not-dict fst.
# Todo: Flags in testing/Makefile for using different fst-s.
