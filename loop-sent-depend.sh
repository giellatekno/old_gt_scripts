# loop-sent-depend.sh
# This is a shell script for analysing (at the moment, only) Northern SÃ¡mi sentences with the vislcg3 parser.
# It gives the analysis, and optionally the number of the disambiguation rules.

#usage:
# <script_name> (-t)
# to output the number of disambiguation rules, too, use the parameter '-t'

# You need to make GT_HOME point to your gt/ directory, normally one of the two following:
# export GT_HOME=/Users/<your_user_name> 
# export GT_HOME=/Users/<your_user_name>/Documents

# todo: parametize for language!
# possible todo: this can be merged with loop-sent-disamb.sh they are almost the same
