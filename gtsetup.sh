# Shell script for preparing the user's shell startup scripts for Giellatekno

# Giellatekno - a set of tools for analysing and processing a number
#               of human languages, expecially but not restricted to
#               the SÃ¡mi languages. The Giellatekno toolset also includes
#               support for buildling end-user tools such as proofing
#               tools and electronic dictionaries.
# The setup and init scripts (ao this file) are based on similar scripts
#               from the Fink project (http://www.finkproject.org/).
# This file is based on the file /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh in the Fink distro.

# set_gthome is robust wrt to spaces in dirnames, and also from
# where the script is called (ie it can be called from anywhere).

# First we need to find the full pathname from the root
# to the script file:
	dirname=$(dirname "$0")
	pwd=$(pwd)
#	if dirname = '.' then $pwd contains the full path:
	if [ "$dirname" == "." ]; then
		tmp=$pwd
#	else if pwd = '/' then $dirname contains the full path:
	elif [ "$pwd" == "/" ]; then
		tmp=$dirname
#	else concatenate $pwd and $dirname with a / in between:
	else
		tmp="$pwd/$dirname"
	fi
# Now tmp contains the full path to the setup script, and we
# remove the last 2 dirs to get GTHOME:
	tmp2="${tmp%/*}"
	GTHOME="${tmp2%/*}"
	GTPARENT="${GTHOME%/*}"
