# Shell script for preparing the user's shell startup scripts for Giellatekno

# Giellatekno - a set of tools for analysing and processing a number
#               of human languages, expecially but not restricted to
#               the SÃ¡mi languages. The Giellatekno toolset also includes
#               support for buildling end-user tools such as proofing
#               tools and electronic dictionaries.
# The setup and init scripts (ao this file) are based on similar scripts
#               from the Fink project (http://www.finkproject.org/).
# This file is based on the file /sw/bin/pathsetup.sh in the Fink distro.

# export  GTBIG=~/langtech/big    # if the biggies repository is checked out
# export GTPRIV=~/langtech/priv   # if the private repository is checked out

Since you have changed your login shell to $LOGINSHELL,
I am confident that you know what you are doing.\n
So now add lines equivalent to
		
	GTHOME=$GTHOME
	export GTHOME
	source \$GTHOME/gt/script/init.d/init.sh

to one of your $LOGINSHELL startup scripts
and you will be set up for using the Giellatekno tools.
	    
    Have a nice day.
