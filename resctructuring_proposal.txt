Some ideas/proposals for possible restructuring of the script directory:

1. General issues:

   1.1. moving all scripts which are not language related out of the lanuguage individual dirs to the script-dir
          - e.g., routines from the testing dir

   1.2. sticking to transparent name convention rules for naming files
          - e.g., "parse_cg_sme.sh"  (what? --> parse; which formalism? --> cg; for which language? --> sme) instead of "cealkka2"    
          - since the toolse might be used by other groups than ours, I would suggest to use English names.

   1.3 when restructuring, we should take into accout the fact that we want to merge also the language dirs (gt and st)


2. Action points:

   2.1. check the usability of the files marked with "NULL" in the scripts/00_README.txt file and if not needed delete 

   2.2. usage-based script restructuring

       A. language scripts/tools 

         2.2.1. general scripts (scripts usable in at least two different tasks, e.g., language guesser)
   
         2.2.2. preprocessing, corpus acquisition, 

         2.2.3 word-level processing: acquisition of new words from corpus (should be automatized), FST

	 2.2.4 sentence-level: parsing, sentence alignment, etc. 

        2.2.5 Machine Translation 

        2.2.6. Spellchecking

        2.2.7. Text-to-Speech

       2.2.8. dictionaries, terminology work

    B. infrastructure scripts/tools

       2.2.9 web-related scripts: php, cgi

       2.2.10 other admin routines (e.g., restart_divvun)



   2.3 moving tools (language guesser itself plus its resources, Saami XML parser) to the src directory
         - here we should differentiate bewteen tools implemented by ourselves and tools whose source code we got and can modify

         - in the script dir, we could have only "scripts", i.e., routines that not need compilation

This means that there are five places where language tools can reside:
 - nonlocally: e.g., on victorio
 - installed somewhere outside gtsvn
 - in gtsvn/src
 - in gtsvn/gt/script (this would be moved up to gtsvn after the merging of gt and st)
 - in some domain-specific directory
